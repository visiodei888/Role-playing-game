This is a very basic Role Playing Game(RPG) that I built using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT with the assistance of freeCodeCamp. Its features are:
1) User has XP, health, weapons and gold.
2) User can purchase health and weapons using gold.
3) User has to face different monsters with varying degrees of danger level.
4) Ultimate monster is the dragon.
5) User can Attack, Dodge or Run from a monster.
6) User can sell weapons to earn gold
7) There is an additional easter egg feature hidden in the game. (Play to find out!)
